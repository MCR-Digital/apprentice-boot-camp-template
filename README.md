<!--- ORGANISER THINGS TO CONSIDER 
- Which technical competencies, behaviours and knowledge module topics does the bootcamp cover/meet
- Structuring retros so that they can inform thinking for individual's personal learning records (off the job training record tab in their learning logs)
- Introducing some sort of test or quiz on basic concept learning points from the bootcamp to validate that they have taken stuff in, and provide organisation mentors with results to help them focus follow ups

### Follow-on tasks

Organisation mentors should look to exercise the knowledge we’ve covered in the boot camp. Below are suggestions for tasks that would do this, but please use your own judgement to work out what to do. There is no need for anything to be returned to MD or the presenters—it’s just a learning exercise.
